    <h1>Monarch Butterfly</h1>
    <h2>Facts Related To Monarch Butterflies:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Monarch butterflies have slow motion clapping wings. Frankly, the average butterfly does flap its own wings nearly 20 times per second. But as for the monarch butterfly, it does flap its wings nearly just 5 to 12 times per second.</li>
    <li>In the United States, monarch butterflies do travel 3,000 miles annually, which is equivalent to 4,828 kilometers. This annual migration begins in both northeast United States and Canada and does finish in southwest Mexico. Frankly, the migration does take place over four generations of butterflies.</li>
    <li>Monarch butterflies prove to be poisonous. Monarch butterflies do feast on poisonous milkweed during just their larval stage, which is stored right in the body. Obviously, the poison, which is cardiac glycosides, prompts predators to vomit, although it rarely leads to death. The brightly hued wings of the monarch butterfly serve  as a "warning sign" to deter hungry predators quite literally.</li>
